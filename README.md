### Design Thoughts
- There can be like two stage development cycle
	- First is where we have our SDR written from scratch
	- Second is RTL-SDR with other capabilties added to the PCB

## Maximum Specifications

Battery Voltage: 3.7V
Battery Capacity: 1000mAh = 1000mAh
Efficiency : 80%
Battery Life (FULL USE):   **Discharging Time = Battery Capacity x Battery Volt / Device Watt.**
1Ah x 3.7V * efficiency / 1W(usage-max) = 2.9Hr  

## Anteena Specs

Switched through SPDT Switch

20khz - 20mhz -> Ferrite Rod Anteena
10mhz - 100mhz -> ?
100mhz - 1 Ghz-> Wire based dipole anteena
100mhz - 1Ghz -> chip anteena
2ghz - 10ghz -> Chip anteena
Wifi -> Chip Anteena

## Design Inspiration

RTL SDR ->  Taken from Datasheets
Linux Subsystem ->
Wifi Module -> ESP8266

Since R820T Doesnt have HF Specs we need to use a Hardware mod that directly connects the amplified signal to HF band. (mentioned in URL), We have devised a 9db common base amplifier to amplify the HF band to feed to rtlsdr

We have designed seperate schematic board for 20khz - 20mhz and 1ghz - 10ghz bands
This allows us to either create specific board or hats if required or incorporaste into the final board , away from the main control systems.

0.6Ghz - 3.1 Ghz : SR4L054
3Ghz - 10Ghz : 3100AT51A7200001E

RF Amp and switcher: ADL8112
Attentuator: TGL4203-SM
RF Preamp: [HMC788ALP2E](https://www.digikey.in/en/products/detail/analog-devices-inc/HMC788ALP2E/5268980)
VLF Active anteena : [An Active Ferrite Rod Antenna with Remote Tuning](38815473.pdf)
10Ghz LP: LFCW-8700+
48 Mhz BPF: BPF-B48+
75 Mhz BPF: BPF-B76+

## Specifications

#### R820T Tuner:
- Frequency range: 25 to 1766 MHz
- Noise figure : 3.5 dB @ RF_IN
- Phase noise: -98 dBc/Hz @ 10 kHz
- Current consumption: ï¼œ178 mA @ 3.3V power supply
-  Max input power: +10 dBm
- Image rejection: 65 dBc

#### RTL232 DSP:

- Differential input impedance of the RTL 283 chip is approximately 3,300 Ohms

Oscillator : MAX2871
Layer stackup should be 4 layer with: RF DC, GND, RF DC, GND
Using Si5351A for XREF generation
